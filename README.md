die_roller
==========

simple command-line based die roller for tabletop games. Takes as argument a formatted die-roll including the number of rolls, the number of sides on the die, and a positive modifier. For example, to roll 2 20-sided dice and add 5 to their sum, you would format your roll: 2d20+5.

Tested using GCC with -Wall.
