die_roller
==========

Simple command-line based die roller for tabletop games. Takes as sole argument a formatted die-roll including the number of rolls, the number of sides on the die, and a positive or negative modifier. For example, to roll 2 20-sided dice and add 5 to their sum, you would format your roll: 2d20+5. Likewise, you can use a negative modifier by using a minus sign instead of a plus: 2d20-5.
